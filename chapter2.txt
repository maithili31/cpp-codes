A. true/false - 
    1. * or /,+ or - represents correct hierarchy of arithmetic operators. - true
    2. [] and {} can be used in arithmetic instructions. - false 
    3. hierarchy decides which operator is used first - true
    4. in C , arithmetic instructions cannot contain constants on left side of =. - true
    5. in C ** operator is used for exponentiation operation. - false
    6. % operator cannot be used with floats. - true
B. FITB :-
    1.in y=10*x/2+z; 2+z operation will be performed first.
    2. if 'a' is an integer value , a=11/2 will store 5 in 'a'.
    3. expression a=22/7*5/3; would evaluate to 5.
    4. expression x=-7%2-8; would evaluate to -11.
    5. if d is float the operator d=2/7.0 would store 0.2857142 in d
