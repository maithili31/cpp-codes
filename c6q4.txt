1. three parts of loop expression in for loop -
    initializing , test , incrementing
2. break statement is used to exit from -
    loop
3. do-while loop is useful when we want that the statement within the loop must be executed -
    atleast once
4.sequence in do-while loop :
    initializing, execution , testing
5.keyword used to take control to beginning of loop - continue
6.homw many time will the while loop be executed - 
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main () {
        int j=1;
        while (j<=255) {
            printf ("%c %d", j,j);
            j++;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    ans= 255 times.
7.  write true and false -
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main () {
        int x=10,y=100%90;
        for (i=1;i<=10;i++);
        if (x!=y);
        printf ("x=%d y=%d",x,y);
        return 0;
    }

    error - i defined nhi hai.. int lagane se chlega 

    a. printf is called 10 times - true
    b. output will be x=10 y=10 - true
    c. the ; after if wont produce error - true 
    d. no output is produced - false 
    e. printf is called infinite times - false.
8. which is true for -'for' loop ?
    a. for loop works faster than while loop. - true
    b. all the things that can be done using for loop can also be done by while loop. - true
    c. for (;;) implements an infinite loop - true
    d. for loop can be used if we want statement to be executed atleast once - false
    e. for loop works faster than do-while loop. - true.
